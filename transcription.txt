 A rest day is a day on which no weight training occurs. For the purposes of
most of the people watching this channel, who weight training is kind of their
sport, it's their hobby, it's their activity. Some cardio is okay. If it's easy
cardio, if it's just activity and get your 10 to 12k steps a day, that's totally
cool. Still counts as a rest day. Extra cardio. It's not a good idea, and it
doesn't make that day count as a rest,
