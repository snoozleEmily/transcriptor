## Contributing [WIP]

**Contributions are welcome!** Below are some guidelines to help you get started:

#### **Windows Users** 
[This setup script seems to be a little buggy and it is outdated, if you do need it ASAP, please let me know]
If you're on Windows, simply run `setup.bat`. The script will handle all the tools and setup configurations required. Yes, I did more work so you would not have to. You're welcome!

#### **Other Operating Systems**
If you're working on a different operating system `or want to manually arrange your setup`, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python and Git**:
   - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

2. **Install FFmpeg**:
   - Download [FFmpeg](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/download/latest/ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl.zip).
   - Add FFmpeg to your system's `PATH`.

3. **Clone the Repository**:
   Copy the repository to your machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/snoozleEmily/transcriptor
   ```

4. **Set Up the Virtual Environment**:
   - Navigate to the root folder of the repository:
     ```bash
     cd <repository-folder>
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
     ```
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
     ```

5. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install all required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   python -m textblob.download_corpora  # Downloads NLTK data for TextBlob
  
6.  [there is another step to add for the newer versions - how to setup `pydub`]

7. **Run the Script**:
   You're ready to go! Run the script with:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
